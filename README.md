### Base Construction
##### Description
> In order to fit all of the necessary aspects incorporated with the Box such as the wires, battery mount (power supply), arduino and breadboard, and photoresistor, we needed an area to store all of this.  This is where the base came in, as we decided that with a base we would be able to fit all of the necessary components while still having a singular box, as the jack and the base would attach to each other.  We did this using a friction fit style, creating a 5 side box with an open top, using 2mm acrylic to reserve material and resources.  Next, in order to make the box stay on the box we had to make a shelf, aligned across the inside of each wall that the Jack in the Box could sit on.  Then, we extruded and cut as necessary in order to provide holes for screws, switches, ect.  Finally, we needed a top to this box that was removable for adjustments but sturdy to provide something for the springs to push against; we did this also using acrylic, and we provided open spaces for the photoresistor and breadboard as necessary, while designing it so that it would fit snug across to shelf designed on the walls of the base.

##### Reflection
> All in all the contruction and printing istelf was reletively easy despite a few hicups, howver after going through it, here are a few take ways from my experience creating this... 
> - When possible, always try to use accrilic and laser cut.  We had orriginally planned to 3D print the entire this, howver we that would have cost almost 10 times the amount of, which was esspecial helpful considering the fact that we had to reprint.
> - Friction fit is an extermely efficient and easy way to attach things such as a box together.
> - Always leave yourself more room than anticpated.  This came up as we had orriginaly not left oursleves enough space to make the actually Jack s=attatch to the base, however we were able to fix this through extruding the walls 3mm's up and than reprinting.
> - Mentaly walk through the design and the CONSTRUCTION OF THE OTHER PIECES TO THE BOX! I say this because we had trouble attching the differnet aspects because they seemed to fit on OnShape howver when doing it by hand it was much more difficult, so just double check.

> All in all it was a fun build and I am super happy with the way it came out.
