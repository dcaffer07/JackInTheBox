### Base Construction
##### Description
> In order to fit all of the necessary aspects incorporated with the Box such as the wires, battery mount (power supply), arduino and breadboard, and photoresistor, we needed an area to store all of this.  This is where the base came in, as we decided that with a base we would be able to fit all of the necessary components while still having a singular box, as the jack and the base would attach to each other.  We did this using a friction fit style, creating a 5 side box with an open top, using 2mm acrylic to reserve material and resources.  Next, in order to make the box stay on the box we had to make a shelf, aligned across the inside of each wall that the Jack in the Box could sit on.  Then, we extruded and cut as necessary in order to provide holes for screws, switches, ect.  Finally, we needed a top to this box that was removable for adjustments but sturdy to provide something for the springs to push against; we did this also using acrylic, and we provided open spaces for the photoresistor and breadboard as necessary, while designing it so that it would fit snug across to shelf designed on the walls of the base.
